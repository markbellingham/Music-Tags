# Music Tags
This project was created to provide a more comprehensive database for projects similar to the Congo project. The database provided for the Congo project was quite limited and so a desire to create a bigger database using a music collection was formed. Since the music collection contains in excess of 20,000 tracks, a program was needed to parse the files, extract the tag data and format it into an SQL script that could be used to insert data into pre-defined database tables.

The program currently supports MP3, FLAC, and OGG.
